# lightweight applications

I'm using fluxbox and trying to avoid gnome and kde land.
Unless otherwise stated, these apps are in the official repo.

- clipboard manager: **parcellite**  
  unmaintained, but still works fine. *clipit* is in aur.
- torrent: **qbittorrent**
- ftp: **filezilla**
- gtk theme selector: **lxappearance**
- xrandr gui: **lxrandr**
- desktop system monitor: **conky**
- toolbar: **tint2**  
  in case I need something fancy with icons
- pdv viewer: **qpdfview**  
  or *mupdf*, but that's brutally bare.
  or *foxitreader*, but that's a mess on linux, adobe is crap.
- image viewer: **viewnior**  
  or **mirage** from aur, but they are very very similar to each other.
- media players: **smplayer**, **vlc**  
  nothing interesting here; smplayer has proper acceleration though,
  no screen tearing on my intel integrated gpu.
- audio player: good old **audacious**  
  or **mpd** on my standalone laptop.
- pulse audio: **pavucontrol**, **paprefs**  
  for a popup volume setter I use the console **alsamixer**
- audio control via keyboard: **ponymix**  
  toggle, increase, decrease etc. in fb keys file.
- bluetooth gui: **blueberry**  
  but bluetooth is unstable, so it doesn't matter. *bluetoothctrl* is terrible.
- backlight control: **xbacklight**
- gui editor: **geany**
- terminal: **urxvt** or maybe **lxterminal** which is slow (as a vte wrapper)  
  or there is *lilyterm* in aur which is fast, but is unmaintained.
- tray battery monitor: **cbatticon**  
  or *batterymon-clone* from aur which has a nicer icon.  
  or the builtin one in tint2.

## AUR only

- merge pac configs: **etc-update**  
  just like in gentoo
- synaptics configuration: **gpointing-device-settings**  
  or do it manually like in the wiki
- access mac formatted stuff: **hfsprogs**
- aur: **trizen**  
  now that yaourt is unmaintained
